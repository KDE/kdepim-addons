    // have to put this class to a .so and link it from both to get a
    // singleton that actually works across the plugins. But being the lazy
    // bastard that I am I decided to just abuse QObject::property() and the qApp
    // singleton which already comes from an .so linked by both plugins.

    // SettingsChangeNotifier::staticMetaObject as each "copy" of the class
    // has its own instance of it, which causes  pointer comparison in
    // QMetaObject::inherits() to fail. This leads to v.isValid() being true but
    // v.value<SettingsChangeNotifier*>() returning a null pointer, because
    // the internal qobject_cast fails.
